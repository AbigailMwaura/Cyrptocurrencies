# Cyrptocurrencies
This challenge was about exploring how cryptocurrencies can be observed in the trading market and how they are grouped to create a classification system. We applied PCA algorithm to reduce the dimensions of the X DataFrame, we used the K-means algorithm to create an elbow curve and hvPlot to find the best values for K. K- assisted in predicting K-clusters for cryptocurrencies data. After the clusters were predicted we visualized the distinct groups that corresponded to the different principal componenets, and a table with all the cryptocurrencies was created.
